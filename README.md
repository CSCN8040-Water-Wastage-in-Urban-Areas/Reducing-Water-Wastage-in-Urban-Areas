# Reducing Water Wastage in Urban Areas

This repository documents a project aimed at revolutionizing urban water management by reducing water wastage using a data-driven approach inspired by the Toyota A3 8-Step process. The project focuses on tackling the root causes of water leakage in urban distribution networks by integrating AI-based leak detection, predictive maintenance, and smart infrastructure investments.

## Project Overview

Urban water distribution systems face significant inefficiencies—up to 25% of the water distributed is wasted. This project targets a 70% reduction in water wastage, decreasing the loss from 2.337 billion cubic meters per year to 0.701 billion cubic meters per year.

### Key Objectives

- **Reduce Water Loss:** Address leakage in distribution networks, currently a major contributor to water wastage.
- **Improve Infrastructure:** Replace outdated materials and enhance maintenance practices.
- **Integrate Technology:** Utilize AI and IoT sensors for real-time leak detection and predictive maintenance.
- **Reallocate Budget:** Influence municipal budgeting to prioritize sustainable water infrastructure improvements.

## Team Members

- **Gonuguntla, Keerthi** – Team Leader & AI/ML Coordinator (Conestoga College)  
- **Karunanithi, Ranjan** – Data Analyst
- **Pallothu, Maruthi Venkata Manikanta Chowdary** – Quality Assurance
- **Prathap, Sreehari** – Developer
- **Tuppari, Shri Vardhan Reddy** – Developer

## Timeline

- **Start Date:** January 6, 2025
- **Planned Duration:** 4 Months

## Problem Statement

Inefficient urban water distribution systems result in significant water wastage. The primary causes include:
- **Aging Pipelines:** Contributing to approximately 1.402 billion cubic meters/year of loss.
- **Poor Maintenance:** Contributing to roughly 0.935 billion cubic meters/year of loss.
  
Additional factors include outdated infrastructure, insufficient budget allocation, and lack of real-time monitoring systems.

## Target & Sub-Targets

- **Overall Water Wastage:**
  - **Current:** 2.337 billion cubic meters/year
  - **Target Reduction:** 70% (down to 0.701 billion cubic meters/year)
- **Aging Pipelines:**
  - **Current Loss:** 1.402 billion cubic meters/year
  - **Target Reduction:** 67% (down to 0.468 billion cubic meters/year)
- **Poor Maintenance:**
  - **Current Loss:** 0.935 billion cubic meters/year
  - **Target Reduction:** 75% (down to 0.234 billion cubic meters/year)

## Root Cause Analysis

A detailed 5-Why Analysis identified:
1. **Leakage Causes:** Aging pipelines and poor maintenance.
2. **Aging Pipelines:** Due to outdated materials and insufficient infrastructure investment.
3. **Budget Constraints:** Limited upgrades from low prioritization of water infrastructure.
4. **Lack of Data-Driven Decisions:** Municipal planning suffers from inadequate real-time monitoring.

## Proposed Countermeasures

1. **AI-Based Leak Detection:** Deploy IoT sensors to monitor leaks and optimize repair schedules.
2. **Smart Infrastructure Investment:** Replace aging pipelines with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes and other advanced materials.
3. **Predictive Maintenance:** Utilize machine learning to forecast failures and schedule proactive repairs.
4. **Budget Reallocation:** Advocate for data-driven budget adjustments to better support water infrastructure improvements.

## Research Hypothesis

*Implementing AI-based leak detection and predictive maintenance will achieve a water wastage reduction of at least 70% in urban distribution networks.*

- **Dependent Variable:** Water wastage reduction (both in percentage and cubic meters).
- **Independent Variable:** Adoption of AI-based monitoring and smart maintenance strategies.

## Data Sources

- **Water Leak Dataset:** Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/water-leak-dataset).
